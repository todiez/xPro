what is the difference between "npm start" and "npm run start"

what does webvitals from React?


what is the difference between hashrouter and browser router? What is switch?


SPA means that there is merely one request to the server once you 
open up the site in your browser. Further, the routing is done
by react in the browser on the front end.
What about the content then? All "not showed pages" must be already
loaded and available once a user hits a button.
