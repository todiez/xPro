Title of the project: Real Time Bus Tracker

Description of the project: The current project shows all operational busses of the chosen route.


How to Run: This applications runs automated once you started it by clicking the buttons for the route you want to track.

Roadmap of future improvements: Changing the color of the markers, so that you can the see the past locations in blue and the current one in red.
Additional routes and cities might also be a nice additional feature.
Removing some tracking would be useful, too.
